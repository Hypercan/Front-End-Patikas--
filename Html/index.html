    <!-- How I started to Web-Dev -->
    <p>Hello there <br>
        My name is Fırat and I am learing Web-Development from the Team Patika. <br>
        First, that was hard but step by step instructions are made the progress easier then I thought. <br>
        Right now the only thing I do, Reading Book, going to Gym and Learning Code :)

    <!-- My hobbies and What I do generally -->
    <h2>The things I like to do:</h2>
    <p> Fitness</p>
    <p> Reading Books</p>
    <p> Creating 3D-Models by using Blender.</p>
    <p> Playing Piano</p>
    <p> Learing Languages (currently: getting better at german)</p>
    <p>When I am with my family, we watch some TV series or movies on Netflix.<br>
        The last one was <b>The Sandman</b>. It's a fantasy series based on a comic book. The main character is one of
